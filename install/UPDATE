If you are running a 1.9.1 or below version of Concerto, and would like to upgrade to Concerto 1.9.2 this may be of some help:
0.  Backup everything.  I make a habit of cp -R concerto ~/current_concerto just to make sure I don't loose anything.
1.  Replace all your Concerto files with the new ones, obviously nothing in your content/images or content/templates directory 
    should get overridden, neither should your config.inc.php. 
2.  Open up config.inc.php and delete the VERSION line that say 1.9.2.  This is stored in its own file so you don't have to
    manually update it anymore.
3.  If you use Info Pages a lot (specifically the categories) and have been getting errors, you'll want to set "auto increment"
    on the id field of the "page_category" table.  You should probably backup your database first, and watch out for any
    categories with id=0.
4.  If you're using memcache or do any php caching, you should restart the appropriate services.  There were a few changes to
    image rendering and you might have bad caches for transparent PNG's.
5.  Enjoy Concerto 1.9.2.  If you have any feedback, send it along!
